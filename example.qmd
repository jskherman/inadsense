## An Example

**Hi world**! *Below* this text you can find an ad by replacing it with a javascript `<script>` block. What do you think would be below this?

{{< inadsense >}}

Above this line is an ad, with a label under it that says "Advertisement". Nothing will show up above it because you have to specify your own credentials first in `_quarto.yml`. You also need to accept the cookie consent for ads and targeting cookies as well.

Try inspecting this page by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` on Windows or `Cmd` + `Shift` + `I` on a Mac. You can also try with `F12` or right-clicking on "Advertisement" and choosing `Inspect`. You will see a `<ins>` tag and depending on your [cookie preferences](#open_preferences_center) you might see an iframe with the ad in it. But for now it is not there since we have not specified Google Adsense credentials yet in this website.

## Installing

```sh
quarto install extension jskherman/inadsense
```

This will install the [extension](https://github.com/jskherman/inadsense) under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check this in this directory.

## Usage

It is required that you need to specify `cookie-consent` and Google Adsense credentials in `_quarto.yml` first before you can insert ad units.

Example: 
```yaml
website:
  cookie-consent:
    type: express # or implied

adsense:
    client: "ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"   # data-ad-client
    slot:   "1234567890"                # data-ad-slot
```

You can get your credentials by signing up for a [Google Adsense account](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/), going to the `Ads` option on the left sidebar and creating a new in-article ad. For more information please refer to how this was achieved via Hugo by at godo.dev: [Inserting an Ad Unit to Hugo Content without Shortcode](https://www.godo.dev/tutorials/hugo-in-article-ad/)

After that, you can then use the shortcode `{{< inadsense >}}` in your `qmd` files to embed ad units in pages.
